# 🚀 MyOwnCryptocurrency-Maverick

**🪙 MAVERICK (MAV)** is a custom ERC-20 token smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet.  
This project is a hands-on implementation of creating your own cryptocurrency token using **Solidity**, **Remix IDE**, and **MetaMask**.

## 📖 About

This repository contains the smart contract code and deployment scripts for **MAVERICK** — my first personal token built as part of the *"Create Your Own Token on Binance"* course from Metaschool.  
Due to limited BNB testnet tokens, the contract was deployed on the **Sepolia Ethereum testnet**, showcasing flexibility across EVM-compatible networks. 🔄
